# Hand-Gesture-Recognition

Hand gesture recognition involves the use of sensors, cameras, or advanced machine learning algorithms to capture and analyze the intricate movements and configurations of the human hand. These systems can detect and interpret gestures, enabling users to convey commands or communicate in sign language without the need for traditional input devices like keyboards or touchscreens.
